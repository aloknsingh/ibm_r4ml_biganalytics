# Big Data Preparation and Exploration using R4ML

In this Code Pattern we will use R4ML, a scalable R package, running on IBM Watson Studio to perform various Machine Learning exercises. For those users who are unfamiliar with Watson Studio, it is an interactive, collaborative, cloud-based environment where data scientists, developers, and others interested in data science can use tools (e.g., RStudio, Jupyter Notebooks, Spark, etc.) to collaborate, share, and gather insight from their data.

When the reader has completed this Code Pattern, they will understand how to:

* Use [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) to load, visualize, and analyze data.
* Run Notebooks in [IBM Watson Studio](https://dataplatform.ibm.com).
* Leverage [R4ML](https://github.com/SparkTC/r4ml) to conduct data preparation and exploratory analysis with big data.

The Intended audience for this Code Pattern is data scientists who wish to perform scalable feature engineering and data exploration.

R4ML provides various out-of-the-box tools, and a preprocessing utility for doing the feature engineering. It also provides utilities to sample data and do exploratory analysis. This specific Code Pattern will provide an end-to-end example to demonstate the ease and power of R4ML in implementing data preprocessing and data exploration. For more information about additional R4ML functionality, support, documentation, and roadmap, please vist [R4ML](https://github.com/SparkTC/r4ml)

This Code Pattern will walk the user through the following conceptual steps:

* Large-scale exploratory analytics and data preparation.
* Dimensionality reduction.
* How to use your favorite R utilities on big data.
* Highlights the steps necessary to complete data preparation and exploration.

### Source of data

- We will use the Airline On-Time Statistics and Delay Causes from [RITA](http://www.rita.dot.gov). A 1% sample of the "airline" dataset is available [here](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html). All of the data is in the      public domain.
- For this Code Pattern, we will use a subset of the above dataset, which is shipped with R4ML
- This Code Pattern can also work with the larger RITA dataset.

The first [notebook](https://github.com/IBM/r4ml-on-watson-studio/tree/master/notebooks/R4ML_Introduction_Exploratory_DataAnalysis.ipynb) is for exploring, and the second [notebook](https://github.com/IBM/r4ml-on-watson-studio/tree/master/notebooks/R4ML_Data_Preprocessing_and_Dimension_Reduction.ipynb) performs data pre-processing and deminsion reduction analysis. 
> * While viewing the notebook, you can optionally download it to store for future use.
> * When complete, continue this code pattern by jumping ahead to the [Explore and Analyze the Data](#explore-and-analyze-the-data) section.

### 2. Create a new Watson Studio project

* Select the `New Project` option from the Watson Studio landing page and choose the `Data Science` option.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/pattern-images/master/watson-studio/project_choices.png)

* To create a project in Watson Studio, give the project a name and either create a new `Cloud Object Storage` service or select an existing one from your IBM Cloud account.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/pattern-images/master/watson-studio/new_project.png)

* Upon a successful project creation, you are taken to a dashboard view of your project. Take note of the `Assets` and `Settings` tabs, we'll be using them to associate our project with any external assets (datasets and notebooks) and any IBM cloud services.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/pattern-images/master/watson-studio/project_dashboard.png)

### 3. Create the Notebooks

* From the project dashboard view, click the `Assets` tab, click the `+ New notebook` button.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/pattern-images/master/watson-studio/new_notebook.png)

* Give your notebook a name and select your desired runtime, in this case we'll be using the associated Spark runtime.

> Note: For this Code Pattern, set language to `R` and `Spark` version 2.1


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/pattern-images/master/watson-studio/notebook_spark.png)

* Now select the `From URL` tab to specify the URL to the notebook in this repository.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/pattern-images/master/watson-studio/notebook_with_url_spark.png)

* Enter this URL:

```
https://github.com/IBM/r4ml-on-watson-studio/tree/master/notebooks/R4ML_Introduction_Exploratory_DataAnalysis.ipynb
```

* Click the `Create` button.

* Repeat these steps for creating the second notebook, which has the URL:

```
https://github.com/IBM/r4ml-on-watson-studio/tree/master/notebooks/R4ML_Data_Preprocessing_and_Dimension_Reduction.ipynb
```

### 5. Run the notebooks

First run the exploratory nodebook first. Once Complete, run the data processing notebook.

When a notebook is executed, what is actually happening is that each code cell in
the notebook is executed, in order, from top to bottom.

Each code cell is selectable and is preceded by a tag in the left margin. The tag
format is `In [x]:`. Depending on the state of the notebook, the `x` can be:

* A blank, this indicates that the cell has never been executed.
* A number, this number represents the relative order this code step was executed.
* A `*`, this indicates that the cell is currently executing.

There are several ways to execute the code cells in your notebook:

* One cell at a time.
  * Select the cell, and then press the `Play` button in the toolbar.
* Batch mode, in sequential order.
  * From the `Cell` menu bar, there are several options available. For example, you
    can `Run All` cells in your notebook, or you can `Run All Below`, that will
    start executing from the first cell under the currently selected cell, and then
    continue executing all cells that follow.
* At a scheduled time.
  * Press the `Schedule` button located in the top right section of your notebook
    panel. Here you can schedule your notebook to be executed once at some future
    time, or repeatedly at your specified interval.

### 6. Save and Share

#### How to save your work:

Under the `File` menu, there are several ways to save your notebook:

* `Save` will simply save the current state of your notebook, without any version
  information.
* `Save Version` will save your current state of your notebook with a version tag
  that contains a date and time stamp. Up to 10 versions of your notebook can be
  saved, each one retrievable by selecting the `Revert To Version` menu item.

#### How to share your work:

You can share your notebook by selecting the `Share` button located in the top
right section of your notebook panel. The end result of this action will be a URL
link that will display a “read-only” version of your notebook. You have several
options to specify exactly what you want shared from your notebook:

* `Only text and output`: will remove all code cells from the notebook view.
* `All content excluding sensitive code cells`:  will remove any code cells
  that contain a *sensitive* tag. For example, `# @hidden_cell` is used to protect
  your credentials from being shared.
* `All content, including code`: displays the notebook as is.
* A variety of `download as` options are also available in the menu.
